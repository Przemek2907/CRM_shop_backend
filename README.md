# HibernateProjectCRMsystem
A training project for small CRM application, developed using Java and Hibernate


This project depicts my current coding skills, when it comes to Java and Hibernate. Project allows to load the data into tables from files and allows to perform basic CRUD operations on the repository as well as perform complex operations (placing an order), pulling reports. The project consists of 3 layers (repository, data-to-object mapper, service layer). The control flow is based on the java console menu (no front-end layer). 
For the purpose of the validation of the data input, a BUILDER design pattern has been used. In order to creeate always only one DataBase connection pool, a SINGLETON design pattern has been implemented. This project relies heavily on the use of Java interfaces, generics, streams, collections, Optional classes and Hibernate of course.
